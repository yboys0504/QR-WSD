# Quantum-inspired Representation Method for Long-tail Senses of Word Sense Disambiguation


## Work Description
Data imbalance, also known as the long-tailed distribution of data, is very common in the real world and is an important challenge for data-driven algorithms. Due to the long tail phenomenon of word sense distribution in linguistics, it is difficult to learn accurate representations for Low-Frequency Senses (LFSs) in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks. Without data augmentation, exploring representation learning methods that do not rely on large sample sizes is an important means to combat the long tail. In this paper, inspired by the superposition state in quantum mechanics, a representation method in Hilbert space is proposed to reduce the dependence on a large sample size. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of this method; moreover, we verify the effect of the model based on the representation method under the WSD task, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance.
