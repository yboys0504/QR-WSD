# QR-WSD
Data imbalance, also known as the long-tailed distribution of data, is very common in the real world and is an important challenge for data-driven algorithms. Inspired by the superposition state in quantum mechanics, a representation method in Hilbert space is proposed to reduce the dependence on a large sample size.
